# Black-Scholes-with-FDM
Solving the black scholes equation with finite difference methods in MATLAB. To do this we are approximating the equation using a mesh grid and approximating each x' and x'' using a finite number of intervals, discretized. When we have our equations, we find a matrix that is diagnol in nature and can be solved using numerical methods.
